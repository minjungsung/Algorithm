# Reverse Bits

Can you solve this real interview question? Reverse Bits - Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

Note:

 * Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
 * In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement].
